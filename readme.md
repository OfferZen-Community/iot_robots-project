## IoT-Robots Projects Repo for Makers

Have an interesting idea or looking for inspiration? This is the place to share your code with other Makers or to find ideas for things you can do on a Make Day.


### How it works

<i>To see</i> one of the projects listed below, do:

`$ git checkout branch-name`

To push your code, we suggest using the convention `teams/name1-name2-name3` where the names are your Github handles or your names. It's good to share!

### List of Projects

| Project Description | Branch | Makers | Make Day |
| -------------| -------------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| You shake a Sphero and the harder you shake it the brighter the other one gets | teams/erik-emile-andile | erikbotes, emile-jumo, amkhuma | Quebec |
| Dual Sphero PubSub: One Sphero (leader) rolls around with keystrokes and then publishes its coordinates to a topic. The other Sphero (follower) changes colour depending on the <i>quadrant</i> of the leader. | teams/peza8-jasohardy007-brandon2255p | peza8, jasohardy007, brandon255p| Quebec |
| Control Sphero in interesting ways via AWS (e.g. Sphero rolls in a circle and changes colour :D ) | teams/cornelia | Echochi, shenine| Sierra |
| <i>Placeholder</i> | olx-michael-nik | mmsamuel, nikmakan-olx | Sierra |

### Other Ideas

* Control Sphero with voice - Using DialogFlow from previous course or an Amazon Echo
* One Sphero mimicks the movement of the other
* A "Tom and Jerry" game where one (Tom) tries to catch the other (Jerry) :)
* A competitive PubSub "king of the hill" game
