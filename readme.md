## IoT-Robots Projects Repo for Makers

Have an interesting idea or looking for inspiration? This is the place to share your code with other Makers or to find ideas for things you can do on a Make Day :)


### How it works

<i>To see</i> one of the projects listed below, do:

`$ git checkout branch-name`

To push your code, we suggest using the convention `teams/name1-name2-name3` where the names are your Github handles. It's good to share! :D

### List of Projects

| Project Description | Branch | Makers | Make Day |
| -------------| -------------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| Dual Sphero PubSub: One Sphero (leader) rolls around with keystrokes and then publishes its coordinates to a topic. The other Sphero (follower) changes colour depending on the <i>quadrant</i> of the leader. | teams/peza8-jasohardy007-brandon2255p | peza8, jasohardy007, brandon255p| Quebec |
|  | teams/cornelia | Echochi, shenine| Sierra |
|  | teams/geoffrey-nipho | Tango |
|  | olx-michael-nik | makers| |
|  | teams/teamH | makers| |

### Other Ideas

* One Sphero mimicks the movement of the other
* A "Tom and Jerry" game where one (Tom) tries to catch the other (Jerry) :)
* You shake a Sphero and the harder you shake it the brighter the other one gets
